Yesterday I visited <http://BluHomes.com/>'s factory and sample house in Vallejo.  Basically this was the culmination of an idea / venture that
was brewing in my head.  With this blog, I will start describing the venture / opportunity for investors to consider and also
as a real-time example of a 'hyper-startup': a startup executing so fast and furiously that it will make more money than
anyone could imagine in less time and with fewer people than seems possible.

It will seem "inconceivable": please watch the Princess Bride to truly understand that word.

## Who am I?

I am a serial entrepreneur that got incredibly good at executing startups.  To the point where I can launch companies
with internal IT (e.g. email, shares, etc.) and production IT (think Google or Apple servers) and startup-specific
functionality.  After doing the tenth of these startups, I stopped and went on to other things.  Now I am primarily
a software patent expert and help companies like Apple, HP, and Hughes either make a lot of money (Offense) or not lose _any_ money (Defense).  I am
pretty efficient and effective at this, so I also have a lot of free time to help other people out.  So in total, to
get to know me better see the following:

   * LinkedIn profile: <http://linkedin.com/in/markfussell>
   * Primary Book: <http://SlumsOfPaloAlto.com>
   * Teaching others (kids) how to publish: <http://MinimalBuyableBook.com>
   * Going to the US Open in Tennis: <http://SupersonicFox.com>
   * Helping sports instructors: <http://InsanelyGreatTennis.com>
   * Helping farmers: <http://FullOfLifeFood.com>
   * Teaching robotics: <http://PaloBots.com>
   * ...

And now, there is this site, which will transform a community for the better while making investors a lot of money.
