    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I visited <a href="http://BluHomes.com/">http://BluHomes.com/</a>&rsquo;s factory and sample house in Vallejo.  Basically this was the
culmination of an idea / venture that
was brewing in my head.  With this blog, I will start describing the venture / opportunity for investors to consider and also
as a real-time example of a &lsquo;hyper-startup&rsquo;: a startup executing so fast and furiously that it will make more money than
anyone could imagine in less time and with fewer people than seems possible.</p>

<p>It will seem &ldquo;inconceivable&rdquo;: please watch the Princess Bride to truly understand that word.</p>

<p>And now, there is this site, which will transform a community for the better while making investors a lot of money.</p>
